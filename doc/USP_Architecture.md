## Architecture

The objective of the Unified Software Platform (USP) Architecture is to allow
-	the use of multiple protocols supported by the radio,
-	easy integration of new MCU and related boards,
-	easy integration of new Radio and related boards,
-	easy use of the SW in a modern SW development environment.


![USP Architecture](assets/USP_Architecture.png)

The main SW components:
-	Radio Access Controller (RAC)
    -	allows a unified access to radios
    -	manages the time scheduling of requests from the application, the protocols, and other services,
    -	brings with the drivers of the different radios.
-	Protocols
    -	provides a database of existing protocols and services compliant with Radio Access Controller: LBM
    -	can be extended with other protocols based on provided documentation and SW glue.
-	MCU HAL, Radio HAL& BSP tools to allow porting on multiple HW boards.
-	Sample applications  including Multi-Protocol capabilities demonstrators

The first selected SW Platforms is Zephyr RTOS. The USP components are integrated into Zephyr SW Platform as libraries & source code in an external git repository (zephyr module) with the exposition of a set of MCU HAL & Radio HAL & BSP tools being ported externally.

![USP Zephyr Architecture](assets/USP_Zephyr_Architecture.png)

 The Main Examples, Protocols, and RAC lib SW components are platform-agnostic and independent from any SW Platform porting (RTOS, baremetal). Porting to a new SW Platform (RTOS, baremetal) primarly involves adapting the MCU HAL & Radio HAL & PCB configuration layers.


Repositories & file structure : Only 2 git repositories are provided by Semtech (black boxes). The two other are Zephyr git dependancy and the user application git repository.

## Dynamic Behaviour, Priorities, ASAP & Scheduled transactions


### lorawan vs ranging when ranging is low priority

![lorawan vs ranging when ranging is low priority](assets/lorawan_vs_ranging_low_priority.png)
1. uplink LoRaWAN : TX
2. Ranging is started
3. When collision is expected, one ranging round is canceled to allow LoRaWAN RX1 & RX2
4. Ranging go on when possible

### lorawan vs ranging when ranging is very high priority

![lorawan vs ranging when ranging is very high priority](assets/lorawan_vs_ranging_very_high_priority.png)
1. uplink LoRaWAN : TX
2. Ranging is started
3. When collision is expected, LoRaWAN RX1 & RX2 are canceled to allow ranging to continue

### Multi-protocol management

USP/RAC is managing the time scheduling of Modulation Transactions.

#### Principles

- If a scheduled transaction is scheduled but conflicts with another one of higher priority, it is aborted
- If a scheduled transaction is scheduled but conflicts with another request of lower or equal priority not yet finished, the request is aborted at the scheduled date.
- If a ASAP transaction conflicts with another transaction, it is postponed. After a while (defined delay), the ASAP transaction is promoted to a scheduled one and fired as soon as a window is found.
- In other cases, the transactions are scheduled at programmed timestamp in sequence.

In case a transaction is aborted:
- `smtc_usp_submit_radio_transaction()` returns `SMTC_USP_SUCCESS`.
- `callback_pre_radio_transaction()`  is not triggered
- `callback_post_radio_transaction()` is triggered with `RP_STATUS_TASK_ABORTED` rp_status_t at the timestamp when the selected transaction has successfully completed just after Its successful Handle Event

#### Normal Case with scheduled or ASAP Modulation Transactions
![c1a77dce62744963397db428b3e47caf.png](assets/c1a77dce62744963397db428b3e47caf.png)

#### Case with Modulation Actions of different priorities and time conflicts:
![2534e7bf5fad613ab97253c49a8b0c85.png](assets/2534e7bf5fad613ab97253c49a8b0c85.png)
<u>Notes</u>:
- In Red, the scheduled transaction that failed because of time conflict
- In case the transaction failed,
    - the `callback_pre_radio_transaction()` Start Event is not called,
    - the `callback_post_radio_transaction()` Result Event is called after the successful transaction called its `callback_post_radio_transaction()` Result Event

#### Cases with mixed ASAP & scheduled Modulation Actions and time conflicts

ASAP transaction is programmed but cannot be fired before the end of a scheduled transaction of any priority:
![737a6a0d9a3ad377a98881a8d3998c8a.png](assets/737a6a0d9a3ad377a98881a8d3998c8a.png)

In case the ASAP transaction is postponed for too long time, after 120 seconds, It is promoted as a scheduled transaction in order to have more change to be fired:
![18a5ac8fde1cb6367c50a5dcee8d00ed.png](assets/18a5ac8fde1cb6367c50a5dcee8d00ed.png)

In case ASAP transaction priority is lower than scheduled priority, It is cancelled:
![38796166515420220b0f07926334d83e.png](assets/38796166515420220b0f07926334d83e.png)
<u>Notes</u>:
- In Red, the scheduled transaction that failed because of time conflict

In case ASAP transaction priority is higher than scheduled priority, It is postponed during maximum 120 seconds and then promoted as scheduled. The lowest scheduled transaction is then canceled.

![low_prio_schedule_canceld_by_high_prio_asap.png](assets/low_prio_schedule_canceld_by_high_prio_asap.png)

<u>Notes</u>:
- In Red, the scheduled transaction that failed because of time conflict

## Zephyr Integration

The USP implementation provides flexible thread management options to accommodate different application requirements and system architectures. For detailed information about thread management, see [**Thread Management Documentation**](THREAD_MANAGEMENT.md).

### Quick Threading Overview

The implementation supports multiple threading models:

- **Single Thread Mode** (`CONFIG_USP_MAIN_THREAD=n`): Application directly manages USP/RAC
- **Multi-Thread Mode** (`CONFIG_USP_MAIN_THREAD=y`):
  - **Cooperative**: Threads with negative priorities, no protection needed
  - **Preemptive + Mutexes**: Higher priority USP/RAC thread with mutex protection

Each mode offers different trade-offs between simplicity, performance, and real-time responsiveness. The application API remains consistent across all modes through the `SMTC_SW_PLATFORM` macro abstraction.
