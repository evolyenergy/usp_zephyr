# LoRaWAN Geolocation

### Description

This example illustrates how a typical application running LoRa Basics Modem (LBM) can benefit from the **geolocation services** using LR1110/LR1120 transceivers to perform GNSS and Wi-Fi scans and send it either with direct uplinks, or using the Store & Forward service.

This example demonstrates:
- how to configure LoRa Basics Modem library
- how to start the needed services (almanac demodulation update for GNSS scan, store & forward, ...)
- how to program GNSS/Wi-Fi scans
- how to get events from the services to sequence the geolocation scans

### Geolocation services

This example application relies on various services provided by LoRa Basics Modem to simplify the usage of a LR11xx radio to perform geolocation based on GNSS and Wi-Fi scans.

The services used are:
* GNSS scan & send
* GNSS almanac demodulation
* Wi-Fi scan & send
* Store & Forward

For more details about the GNSS and Wi-Fi services, please refer to the documentation here:

Geolocation services documentation: [LOCAL](../../../../../modules/lib/usp/protocols/lbm_lib/smtc_modem_core/geolocation_services/README.md)  [ONLINE](https://github.com/Lora-net/usp/blob/main/protocols/lbm_lib/smtc_modem_core/geolocation_services/README.md)

## Key Features

- **Dual Geolocation Methods**: GNSS (GPS + BeiDou) and Wi-Fi scanning
- **Automatic Scanning**: Periodic GNSS (2 min) and Wi-Fi (1 min) scans
- **Almanac Demodulation**: Enhanced GNSS performance with constellation data
- **Store and Forward**: Geolocation data buffering and transmission
- **Custom ADR Profile**: Optimized for geolocation transmission requirements
- **LED Indicators**: Visual feedback for scanning and transmission states
- **Keep-Alive Messages**: Regular status updates every 30 seconds

## Configuration

### Hardware Requirements

| Component     | Requirement                    |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| Transceiver   | LR1110 or LR1120               |
| Antenna       | GNSS + LoRa antenna or dual antenna setup |
| Network       | LoRaWAN network with geolocation support |

### LoRa Basics Modem configuration
Once the modem has reset, the application configures the various services used and initiate both GNSS and Wi-Fi scans. Then, it completely relies on LBM arbitration to handle LR11xx radio access.

In this example, the device does not need to successfully join a LoRaWAN network to start scanning.
If "Store & Forward" is enabled the scan results are stored in the device's flash memory, and forwarded later once the device has joined a network. Otherwise, the scan results are lost.

Once the modem has joined the LoRaWAN network, the application configures the ADR custom profile.
It is necessary to use a custom profile due to payload size constraints.

### LoRaWAN related configuration

Configure your LoRaWAN credentials in `boards/user_keys.overlay`:

```dts
/ {
    zephyr,user {
        user-lorawan-device-eui = <0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00>;
        user-lorawan-join-eui = <0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00>;
        user-lorawan-app-key = <0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
                               0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00>;
        user-lorawan-region = "EU_868";
    };
};
```

#### Common

The custom ADR profile parameters are defined in the `main_geolocation.c` file.

* CUSTOM_NB_TRANS: The number of retransmission to be done for each LoRaWAN uplink
* ADR_CUSTOM_LIST: The custom datarate distribution to be used for LoRaWAN uplink

Those parameters have to be carefully defined depending of the region of operation, the scan period, the payload size etc...

### Geolocation services events

After the initial scan has been initiated, the application has to rely on the events sent by the GNSS/Wi-Fi services to get results and program the next scan.

The events to be handled are the following:
* SMTC_MODEM_EVENT_GNSS_SCAN_DONE: the GNSS scan service has completed the multiframe scan sequence. The application can retrieve the associated data.
* SMTC_MODEM_EVENT_GNSS_TERMINATED: the GNSS send service has completed the multiframe send sequence according to the selected send mode (direct uplink, store & forward, bypass...). The application must wait for this event before programming the next GNSS scan.
* SMTC_MODEM_EVENT_GNSS_ALMANAC_DEMOD_UPDATE: the GNSS almanac demodulation service has progressed. This event is for information, there is no action to take from the application.
* SMTC_MODEM_EVENT_WIFI_SCAN_DONE: the Wi-Fi scan service has completed the scan. The application can retrieve the associated data.
* SMTC_MODEM_EVENT_WIFI_TERMINATED: the Wi-Fi send service has completed the send sequence according to the selected send mode (direct uplink, store & forward, bypass...). The application must wait for this event before programming the next Wi-Fi scan.
